## Database Development Process
---
## Outline
* Software Development Life Cycle
* Database Life Cycle
* Requirements Gathering
* Analysis
* Logical Design
---
## Outline
* Implementation
* Realizing the Design
* Populating the Database
* Guidelines for ER Diagrams
---
## Software Development Life Cycle
* Waterfall (traditional)
* Agile (contemporary)
---
## Waterfall SDLC
* Requirements Gathering
* Analysis
* Design
* Implementation
* Testing 
* Deployment
* Maintenance
---
## Requirements Gathering
* consultation with stakeholders
* interviews
* outcome is statement of requirements
---
## Analysis
* review statement of requirements
* determine what system should do (not how)
* outcome is a formal specification of the features of the system 
---
## Design
* begins with the system specification
* detailed description of *how* the system should be constructed
---
## Implementation
* construction of a working system based on the design
* takes into account specific environment:
    * hardware
    * operating system
    * programming language 
---
## Testing
* compares implemenation against system specification
* outcome is an acceptance report listing outstanding errors or bugs
* potentially involves re-work of analysis, design, and/or implementation
---
## Deployment
* making built system available to end users
---
## Maintenance
* implementing new features
* fixing bugs
* porting system to new environment
---
## Waterfall Risks
* each phase is completed in its entirety before moving to the next phase
* except possibly after testing
* high risk because a lot of up front effort is required before you get a working system
---
## Agile SDLC
* intended to minimize risks assocaited with waterfall SDLC
* has all of the same elements of the Waterfall SDLC
* doesn't try to specify the entire system up front
* only deal with a handful of features from start to finish over a very short amount of time
* have a working system at the end of each cycle
---
## Database Life Cycle
* can be similar to Waterfall SDLC
* Requirements
* Analysis
* Logical Design
* Implementation
---
## Requirements Gathering
* interview stakeholders
* understand what data needs to be stored
* understand meaning and interpretation of that data
* what are the data items, attributes, constraints, and relationships
* outcome is a data requirements document
---
## Analysis
* begins with data requirements document
* produces a conceptual data model
* can incude defintion of data domains
* conceptual model will be used by database designers
* describes precisely what is required
---
## Logical Design
* starts with conceptual design
* produces a logical schema
* often a relational representation of conceptual model
* output is a detailed relational specification
* all tables and all constraints
---
## Implementation
* construction of database according to logical schema
* heavily influenced by selected DBMS
* need to set up roles and security
* often DBMS has been selected in advance
---
## Realizing the Design
* execute the SQL DDL statements
---
## Populating the Database
* end users use applications for the database
* import external data directly (bulk load)
---
## Guidelines for ER Diagrams
* document all entities
* document all attributes
* select candidate and primary keys
* develop initial ER diagram
* normalize tables
