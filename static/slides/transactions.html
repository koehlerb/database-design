## Transactions
---
## Tranasactions
* ACID Properties
* START TRANSACTION
* COMMIT
* ROLLBACK
---
## ACID Properties
* Atomicity
* Consistency
* Isolation
* Durability
---
## Atomicity
* a sequence of operations are treated as a single operation
* the sequence either fails completely or succeeds completely
* if the transaction fails the database is unchanged
---
## Consistency
* transactions always preserve database invariants
* all constratints that were true before the transaction are still true after the transaction
---
## Isolation
* transactions may execute concurrently
* the database is always in a state as if the statements had executed sequentially
* usually, partial completed transactions are not visible to other transactions
---
## Durability
* once committed a transaction stays committed even in the event of a system failure
* completed transactions must be recorded in non-volatile memory
---
## Example: Updating a record
```sql 
UPDATE Employee 
SET salary = salary + 10000
WHERE name = 'Alice';
```
---
## Example: Transferring money from one bank acccount to another
id|name |balance
--|-----|-------
01|Alice|1000
02|Bob  |2500
---
## Example: Transferring money continued
```sql 
UPDATE Account 
SET balance = balance + 500
WHERE name = 'Alice';

-- what if the system fails here

UPDATE Account 
SET balance = balance - 500
WHERE name = 'Bob';
```
---
## Transactions in MariaDB
* individual DML statements are a transaction
* if you want multiple statements to be a transaction, you have to group them in a START TRANSACTION ... COMMIT block
* if you discover a problem in the middle of a transaction, you can undo it with a ROLLBACK statement instead of COMMIT
---
## Example
```sql 
START TRANSACTION

UPDATE Account 
SET balance = balance + 500
WHERE name = 'Alice';

UPDATE Account 
SET balance = balance - 500
WHERE name = 'Bob';

COMMIT
```
