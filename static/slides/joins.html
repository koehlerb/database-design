## SQL Joins
---
## Joins
* Cartesian Product
* Inner
* Left Outer
* Right Outer
* Full Outer
---
## Cartesian Product
* every row in one table is joined to every row in the other tabe
* sometimes referred to as CROSS JOIN
* implemented in MariaDB with tables separated by a commar or JOIN operator with no ON clause
---
## Cartesian Product
```sql 
SELECT * FROM Book, Author;
```

or 

```sql 
SELECT * FROM Book JOIN Author;
```
---
## Inner Join
* each row in the result set combines values from one row in each table that match on some column
---
## Inner Join
```sql 
SELECT * FROM Book, Author
WHERE Book.authorid = Author.id;
```

or (preferred)

```sql 
SELECT * FROM Book JOIN Author
ON Book.authorid = Author.id;
```
---
## Left Outer Join
* also includes rows from the left table that don't have a match in the right table
---
## Left Outer Join
```sql 
SELECT * FROM Book LEFT JOIN Author
ON Book.authorid = Author.id;
```
---
## Right Outer Join
* also includes rows from the right table that don't have a match in the left table
---
## Left Outer Join
```sql 
SELECT * FROM Book RIGHT JOIN Author
ON Book.authorid = Author.id;
```
---
## Full Outer Join 
* includes rows from both left and right tables that don't have matches in the other tables
* there is no direct FULL OUTER JOIN operator in MariaDB
* must be synthesized using the UNION of a LEFT JOIN and a RIGHT JOIN
---
## Full Outer Join
```sql 
SELECT * FROM Book LEFT JOIN Author
ON Book.authorid = Author.id
UNION
SELECT * FROM Book RIGHT JOIN Author
ON Book.authorid = Author.id;
```
---
## Combining Joins and Projection
* usually use table aliases to shorten the list of projected columns
* underlying data comes from all the attributes from both of the tables
---
## Combining Joins and Projection
```sql 
SELECT b.title, a.name 
FROM Book b LEFT JOIN Author a
ON b.authorid = a.id;
```
---
## Combining Joins and Projection and Selection
* give the first and last names of all actors that have starred in an NC-17 film
---
## Combining Joins and Projection and Selection
* give the first and last names of all actors that have starred in an NC-17 film
```sql 
SELECT UNIQUE a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM `film` f 
JOIN film_actor fa ON f.film_id = fa.film_id 
JOIN actor a ON a.actor_id = fa.actor_id
WHERE f.rating = "NC-17";
```
---
## Combining Joins and Projection and Selection and Aggregation
* how many NC-17 films has each actor starred in?
---
## Combining Joins and Projection and Selection and Aggregation
* how many NC-17 films has each actor starred in?
```sql 
SELECT COUNT(*), a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM `film` f 
JOIN film_actor fa ON f.film_id = fa.film_id 
JOIN actor a ON a.actor_id = fa.actor_id
WHERE f.rating = "NC-17" 
GROUP BY a.first_name, a.last_name;
```
---
## Creating Views
* you can name a complex SELECT statement with a view
---
## Creating Views
```sql 
CREATE VIEW TitleAuthor AS
SELECT b.title, a.name 
FROM Book b LEFT JOIN Author a
ON b.authorid = a.id;
```
---
## Example #1
Produce a list of customer email addresses along with the name of the city they live in. 
---
## Example #2
Produce a list of film titles along with the number of times they have been rented.
---
## Example #3
Produce a list of stores  and the number of items in their inventory.
---
## Example #4
Produce a list of customer email addresses along with the number of "PG" films they have rented.
