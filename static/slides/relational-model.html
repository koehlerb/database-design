## The Relational Data Model
---
## Outline
* Terminology 
* Relation Properties 
* Entity Relationship Model
---
## Relational Model
* foundation of database research
* foundation of many database design methodologies
* foundation of structured query language (SQL)
---
## Domain
* set of all atomic values that valid for an attribute
* atomic: a value that is indivisible
* e.g. the domain WorkDay is the set of {Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri,Sat,Sun}
* e.g. HeadCount is the set of all non-negative integers 
* e.g. OutsideTemperature is the set of floating point values between -273.15 and 60 degrees C
---
## Domain
* IceCreamFlavour?
* CityPopulation?
* PersonMass?
---
## Relation
* also known as a table or file
* named subset of the Cartesian product of a list of domains
* given `$n$` domains denoted `$D_1, D_2, D_3, ..., D_n$`
* relation `$R \subseteq D_1 \times D_2 \times D_3 \times ... \times D_n$`
---
## Attribute
* also known as column or field
---
## Tuple
* also known as row or record
* values for attributes related to a single entity
---
## Degree
* the number of attributes in a relation
---
## Properties of a Relation
* a name distinct from other relations
* no duplicate tuples
* attributes within a tuple are atomic
* values for an attribute come from a single domain
---
## Properties of Relation (continued)
* operations combining data types is not allowed
* each attribute has a distinct name
* the order of attributes is insignificant
* the order of tuples is insignificant
---
## Terminology Key
|Formal Term (Codd)|Alternative #1|Alternative #2|
|------------------|--------------|--------------|
|Relation          |Table         |File          |
|Tuple             |Row           |Record        |
|Attribute         |Column        |Field         |
---
## Entity Relationship Model
---
## Entity Relationship Model
* approximately 50 years old
* *entities*, tables that hold specific information
* *relationships*, associations between entities
---
## Entity 
* object with physical existence (e.g. car, boat, student)
* object with conceptual existence (e.g. account, job, )
---
## Weak Entity
* depends on another entity for its existence 
* its primary key includes the primary key of the parent entity
* e.g. LineItem or OrderItem - depends on a corresponding Product
---
## Strong Entity
* can exist on its own independent of related entities 
* kerenels are strong entities 
* a relation without a foreign key or where the foreign key can be null 
* e.g. Product relation
---
## Entity Type 
* defines a collection of similar entities 
---
## Entity Set
* collection of entities of an entity type at a particular point of time
---
## Independent Entities
* also refered to as kernels 
* primary key may be simple or composite 
* primary key is not a foreign key 
* do not depend on any other entity for their existence 
---
## Dependent Entities 
* also referred to as derived entities 
* used to connect two kernels together 
* existence dependence on two or more tables 
* many to many relationships, associative tables with at least two foreign keys 
---
## Dependent Entities (continued) 
* options for primary key of dependent entity:
	* composite of foreign keys, if unique 
	* composite of foreign keys and additional column(s)
	* create new simple primary key 
---
## Characteristic Entities 
* represent multivalued attributes
* describe other entities
* typically have one to many relationship
* foreign key is used to further identify characterized table
---
## Characteristic Entities (continued)
* primary key options:
	* foreign key plus additional column(s) 
	* create a new simple primary key
---
## Attributes
* an entity is described by a set of attributes
* attribute has a name, associated entity, domain of legal values
---

---
## Types of Attributes
* simple attributes
* composite attributes
* multivalued attributes
---
## Simple Attributes
* come from atomic value domains
---
## Composite Attributes
* consist of a hierarchy of attributes
* e.g. "Address" has "Number", "Street", and "Suburb" parts
---
## Composite Attributes
![composite attributes](http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Simple-and-Composite-Attributes-300x133.jpg)
---
## Multivalued Attributes
* have a set of values for each entity
* e.g. the "Degrees" attribute for an employee where an employee may have multiple degreees
---
## Multivalued Attributes
![multivalued attributes](http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Multivalued-Attribute-300x131.jpg)
---
## Derived Attributes
* an attribute that can be calculated from other attributes
* e.g. age can be derived from birthdate

---
## Keys
* Candidate Key 
* Composite Key 
* Primary Key 
* Secondary Key 
---
## Keys (continued)
* Alternate Key 
* Foreign Key 
* Natural Key 
* Surrogate Key 
* Foreign Key
---
## Keys
* an attribute or a group of attributes whose values can be used to uniquely identify and invidual entity in an entity set
---
## Candidate Key
* simple or composite key that is unique and minimal
* unique because no two tuples in the relaiton have the same values for the candiate key attributes
---
## Composite Key
* composed of two or more attributes
* must be minimal
---
## Primary Key
* one candidate key selected by database designer to be the identifying key for the whole entity set
---
## Secondary Key
* another key used strictly for retrival purposes
---
## Alternate Key
* all other candidate keys
---
## Natural Key
* a key made up of real world attributes
* also known as a domain key or a business key
* problematic if business rules change
* e.g. assume (Name,Birthdate) is OK as a natural key for Employee but then hire another employee with same name and birthdate
---
## Surrogate Key
* an invented attribute solely for the purposes for uniquely identifying tuples
* also known as synthetic key or pseudokey
* stable when business rules change
* e.g. ???
---
## Foreign Key 
* attribute(s) in a table the references the primary key in another table 
* the foreign key and corresponding primary key must be the same data type or domain
---
## Null
* special value in all domains 
* means unknown or inapplicable or missing
* distinct from 0 or blank
* cannot be valid for a key attribute 
* can create problems for aggregate functions
