## Fundamental Concepts, Characteristics, and Benefits of Databases
---
## Outline
* Database
* Database Management System (DBMS)
---
## Database 
* shared collection of related data 
* supports the activities of a particular organization
* defined once
* accessed by various users 
---
## Database Properties 
* represents real-world facts 
* logical, coherent, and internally consistent 
* designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose 
* each data item is stored in a *field* 
* a combination of fields makes up a *table* 
---
## Database Management System (DBMS) 
* programs or software that enables users to create and maintain databases 
* goal of DBMS is to create an environment that is convenient and efficient for managing and accessing data 
---
## DBMS Operations 
* sort 
* match
* link 
* aggregate
* arrange 
---
## DBMS Operations - Sort 
* order records by the contents of one or more fields 
* numeric or alphabetical ordering
* ascending or descending 
---
## DBMS Operations - Match 
* filter records based on some criteria 
* criteria are extremely flexible 
* text match values or pattern
* formulaic criteria on numeric fields 
* combine critera on multiple fields
---
## DBMS Operations - Link 
* complex databases contain multiple tables 
* often want to combine fields across multiple talbes 
* can use matching fields in multiple tables to link related records
---
## DBMS Operations - Aggregate 
* often interested in summary information contained in a database 
* typically applied to numeric fields 
* operations like: MIN, MAX, SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, etc.
---
## DBMS Operations - Arrange 
* sometimes don't want to see all the columns in a table 
* can hide or reorder columns as required 
---
## Characteristics of a DBMS 
* self-describing 
* insulation between programs and data 
* support for multiple views of data 
* sharing of data and multiuser system 
* control of data redundancy 
* enforcement of integrity constraints
* access controls 
* transcation processing 
* backup and recovery 
---
## Self-describing
* datbase contians data describing the structure of the database itself 
* this is called *metadata* 
* richer than what is possible with an ordinary file system alone
---
## Insulation Between Programs and Data 
* applications only need high-level knowlege about logical structure of data 
* DBMS manages low-level details about how the data is encoded and stored in the file system 
---
## Multiple Views of Data 
* a view is virtual table based on the underlying physical tables 
* when the underlying data changes, the data in the view changes 
* a view can be restricted to a subset of data of interest 
---
## Sharing of Data and Mulituser System 
* many users can access the data at the same time 
* the DBMS manages this *concurrency* 
* the DBMS ensures that data are correct and integrity is maintained 
---
## Control of Data Redundancy 
* each data item is only stored in a single place
* occasioanly data is duplicated for performance reasons
* DBMS manages duplicates 
* data can be repeated for the convenience of users through views 
---
## Enforcement of Integrity Constraints 
* ensures that input data is valid 
* various constraints such as format, data type, uniqueness
---
## Access Controls
* not all users will have the same access privileges
* typical privileges are: UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE
* can be different for different users within a database 
* can even be different for different fields within a table
---
## Transaction Processing
* some integrity constraints may require multiple records in multiple tables to be updated simultaneously 
* can define transactions to group related operations 
* transaction manager ensures all or nothing execution of the operations in a transaction 
* also sequences competing transactions from multiple users
---
## Backup and Recovery
* backup: creating a copy of database at a particular point in time
* recovery: restoring a database from a backup after a catastrophic failure
