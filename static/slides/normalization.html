## Normalization
---
## Outline
* Normal forms
* First normal form (1NF)
* Second normal form (2NF)
* Third normal form (3NF)
* Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)
---
## Normal Forms
* *Normalization* is the process of identifying the level of redundancy in a table design
                        and then dividing the table to correct for it
* we can use functional dependencies to assess which normal form a table is in
* there are six standard normal forms
* the last two are pretty esoteric so we only consider the first four
---
## First normal form (1NF)
* a relation is in 1NF if it has no mulit-valued attributes
---
## Getting to 1NF
* if a relation is not in 1NF, for each record with a muti-valued attribute, split
                            into a record for each of the values
---
## Second normal form (2NF)
* a relation is in 2NF if, and only if:
    * it is 1NF, and
    * the primary key is a single attribute OR all non-key attributes are dependent on
                        the the entire primary key if it is composite
---
## Getting to 2NF
* if a relation is not in 2NF:
    1. get to 1NF
    2. for each non-key attribute that is dependent on part of the primary key: 
        1. remove that non-key attribute from the relation
        2. create a new relation with that non-key attribute and its determinant  
---
## Third normal form (3NF)
* a relation is in 3NF if, and only if:
    * it is in 2NF, and
    * no non-key attribute is functionally dependent on any other non-key attribute 
---
## Getting to 3NF
* if a relation is not in 3NF:
    1. get to 2NF 
    2. for each non-key attriubute that is dependent on another non-key attribute: 
        1. remove the depenent non-key attribute form the relation 
        2. create a new relation with that non-key attribute and its determinant 
---
## Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
* a relation is in BCNF if, and only if: 
    * it is in 3NF, and 
    * every determinant is a superkey
* it is extremely rare that a relation is in 3NF and not in BCNF
