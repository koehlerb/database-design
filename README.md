# Database Design

This website is an adaptation of 
[Database Design, 2nd Edition](https://collection.bccampus.ca/textbooks/database-design-2nd-edition-bccampus-96/) 
by Adrienne Watt and Nelson Eng.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
