# Preface

The primary purpose of this text is to provide an open source 
textbook that covers
most introductory database courses. The material in the textbook 
was obtained from a
variety of sources. All the sources are found in at the end of 
each chapter. I
expect, with time, the book will grow with more information and 
more examples.

I welcome any feedback that would improve the book. If you would 
like to add a
section to the book, please let me know.
