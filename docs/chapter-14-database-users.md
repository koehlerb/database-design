# Chapter 14 Database Users

## End Users

End users are the people whose jobs require access to a database 
for querying, updating and generating
  reports.

### Application user

The application user is someone who accesses an existing application 
program to perform daily tasks.

### Sophisticated user

Sophisticated users are those who have their own way of accessing 
the database. This means they do not
  use the application program provided in the system. Instead, they 
  might define their own application or
  describe their need directly by using query languages. These specialized 
  users maintain their personal
  databases by using ready-made program packages that provide easy-to-use 
  menu driven commands, such as MS
  Access.

### Application Programmers

These users implement specific application programs to access the 
stored data. They must be familiar with
  the DBMSs to accomplish their task.

### Database Administrators (DBA)

This may be one person or a group of people in an organization responsible 
for authorizing access to the
  database, monitoring its use and managing all of the resources to support 
  the use of the entire database
  system.
