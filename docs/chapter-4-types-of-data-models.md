# Chapter 4 Types of Data Models

## High-level Conceptual Data Models

High-level conceptual data models provide concepts for 
presenting data in ways that are close to the way
    people perceive data. A typical example is the entity 
    relationship model, which uses main concepts like
    entities, attributes and relationships. An entity 
    represents a real-world object such as an employee or
    a project. Theentity has attributes thatrepresent 
    properties such as an employeeâ€™s name,
    address and birthdate. A relationship represents an 
    association among entities; for example, an employee
    works on many projects. Arelationship exists between 
    the employee and each project.

## Record-based Logical Data Models

Record-based logical data models provide concepts users 
can understand but are not too far
    from the way data is stored in the computer. Three well-known data
    models of this type are relational data models, network data models
    and hierarchical data models.

* The *relational model* represents data as
        *relations*, ortables. For example, in the membership 
        system at Science World, each
        membership has many members (see Figure 2.2 in Chapter 2). 
        The membership identifier, expiry date
        and address information are fields in the membership. 
        The members are individuals such as Mickey,
        Minnie, Mighty, Door, Tom, King, Man and Moose. Each 
        record is said to be an *instance* of
        the membership table.

* The *network model* represents data as record types. This model
            also represents a limited type of one to many 
            relationship called a *set type*, as shown
            in Figure 4.1.

* The *hierarchical model* represents data as a
        hierarchical tree structure. Each branch of 
        the hierarchy represents a number of related records.
        Figure 4.2 shows this schema in hierarchical model notation.

## Key Terms

**instance**: a record within a table
