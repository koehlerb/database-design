# Acknowledgements

## Adrienne Watt

This book has been a wonderful experience in the world of open textbooks. Itâ€™s amazing to see how much
    information is available to be shared. I would like to thank Nguyen Kim Anh of OpenStax College, for her
    contribution of database models and the relational design sections. I would also like to thank Dr.
    Gordon Russell for the section on normalization. His database resources were wonderful. Open Learning
    University in the UK provided me with a great ERD example. In addition, Tom Jewet provided some
    invaluable UML contributions.

I would also like to thank my many students over the years and a special instructor, Mitra
    Ramkay (BCIT). He is fondly remembered for the mentoring he provided when I first started teaching
    relational databases 25 years ago. Another person instrumental in getting me started in creating an open
    textbook is Terrie MacAloney. She was encouraging and taught me think outside the box.

A special thanks goes to my family for the constant love and support I received throughout this
    project.
