[BCcampus Open Education](https://open.bccampus.ca/)
    began in 2012 as the B.C. Open Textbook Project with the goal of making post-secondary education in
    British Columbia more accessible by reducing student costs through the use of openly licenced textbooks
    and other OER. [BCcampus](https://bccampus.ca/about-us/) supports the post-secondary institutions of
    British Columbia as they adapt and evolve their teaching and learning practices to enable powerful
    learning opportunities for the students of B.C. BCcampus Open Education is funded by the [British
        Columbia Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills & Training](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/advanced-education-skills-training), and the [Hewlett Foundation](http://www.hewlett.org/).

Open textbooks are open educational resources (OER) created and shared in ways so that more people have
    access to them. This is a different model than traditionally copyrighted materials. OER are defined as
    teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under
    an intellectual property license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others.[^1] Our open
    textbooks are openly licensed using a [Creative Commons licence](https://creativecommons.org/), and are offered in
    various e-book formats free of charge, or as printed books that are available at cost. For more
    information about this project, please see the [BCcampus Open Education](https://open.bccampus.ca/) website. If you are an instructor
    who is using this book for a course, please fill out our [Adoption of an Open Textbook](https://open.bccampus.ca/adoption-of-an-open-textbook/)
